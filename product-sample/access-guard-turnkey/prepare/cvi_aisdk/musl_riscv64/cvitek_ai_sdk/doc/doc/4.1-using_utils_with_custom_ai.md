# Using Utils with Custom AI

If you want to use your custom AI on cvi boards, you can also use with the utility functions in AI SDK. The utility functions are available in ``libcviai_core.so``. We provide preprocessing and postprocessing related functions.

## Scaling and Quantizing Input Data

We provide two functions with hardware acceleration to do quantization and scaling at the same time.

```c
CVI_S32 CVI_AI_SQPreprocessRaw(cviai_handle_t handle, const VIDEO_FRAME_INFO_S *frame,
                               VIDEO_FRAME_INFO_S *output, const float quantized_factor,
                               const float quantized_mean, const uint32_t thread);
```

This function let developers take full control over the value of factor and mean, but they will have to calculate the quantized factor and mean manually.

```c
CVI_S32 CVI_AI_SQPreprocess(cviai_handle_t handle, const VIDEO_FRAME_INFO_S *frame,
                            VIDEO_FRAME_INFO_S *output, const float factor, const float mean,
                            const float quantize_threshold, const uint32_t thread);
```

This function helps developers to do quantization and scaling at the same time with a friendly interface. Just provide factor, mean, and quantize_threshold and the function will do the rest for you.

## Some Postprocessing Helper Functions

We provide some common postprocessing functions such as dequantize, softmax, and non maximum suppression. For how to fill your result into the structure of AI SDK, please take a look at chapter 4.

```c
CVI_S32 CVI_AI_Dequantize(const int8_t *quantizedData, float *data, const uint32_t bufferSize,
                          const float dequantizeThreshold);

CVI_S32 CVI_AI_SoftMax(const float *inputBuffer, float *outputBuffer, const uint32_t bufferSize);

CVI_S32 CVI_AI_FaceNMS(const cvai_face_t *face, cvai_face_t *faceNMS, const float threshold,
                       const char method);

CVI_S32 CVI_AI_ObjectNMS(const cvai_object_t *obj, cvai_object_t *objNMS, const float threshold,
                         const char method);
```
